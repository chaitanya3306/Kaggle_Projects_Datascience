# Ai's Impact on Jobs
---
## 📊 Dataset Used

- **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset  Link : (https://www.kaggle.com/code/chaitanyashimpi33/ai-s-impact-on-the-job-market)]
- **Description**: The dataset includes job titles, industries, risk of automation, AI relevance scores, and other employment-related indicators.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- `pandas`, `numpy` – Data manipulation  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` – Visualization  
- `sklearn` – ML models & preprocessing  
- `joblib` – Model saving  
- `xgboost`, `randomforest`, `logistic regression` – Classification models  
- `scikit-learn` – Pipeline, Evaluation

## 📌 Project Steps

### 📍 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked missing values and data types
- Analyzed risk levels across industries
- Visualized job trends and AI impact distributions
- Found correlation between job types and automation risk

### 📍 2. Feature Engineering
- Converted categorical features using one-hot encoding
- Created new features like `is_high_risk`, `industry_group`
- Normalized numerical values using `MinMaxScaler`
- Removed irrelevant or noisy features

### 📍 3. Model Building
#### 🧠 Classification Goal: Predict if a job is at **high risk of automation**
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest (tuned)
- XGBoost (final)
  


## 📚 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:
- How to apply EDA to real-world job data  
- Feature engineering techniques for categorical/numerical data  
- Building & comparing ML models with evaluation metrics  
- Using models to predict real-world outcomes (like job risk from AI)
