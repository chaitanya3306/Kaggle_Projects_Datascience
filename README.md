# 📊 AI’s Impact on the Job Market – A Complete Data Science Case Study

> A full-cycle data science project analyzing how AI affects various job sectors — from data analysis to prediction models.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project explores the growing impact of **Artificial Intelligence on employment trends**, job automation risk, and future job opportunities. Using data science techniques like **EDA**, **feature engineering**, and **machine learning models**, the goal is to gain insights and build predictive tools to understand which jobs are at higher risk due to AI.
And this is also begginer freindly so any begginer can refer this for learnig the process of EDA and Prediction

## 📌 Project Steps

### 📍 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked missing values and data types
- Analyzed risk levels across industries
- Visualized job trends and AI impact distributions
- Found correlation between job types and automation risk

### 📍 2. Feature Engineering
- Converted categorical features using one-hot encoding
- Created new features like `is_high_risk`, `industry_group`
- Normalized numerical values using `MinMaxScaler`
- Removed irrelevant or noisy features

### 📍 3. Model Building
#### 🧠 Classification Goal: Predict if a job is at **high risk of automation**
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest (tuned)
- XGBoost (final)
  


## 📚 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:
- How to apply EDA to real-world job data  
- Feature engineering techniques for categorical/numerical data  
- Building & comparing ML models with evaluation metrics  
- Using models to predict real-world outcomes (like job risk from AI)
